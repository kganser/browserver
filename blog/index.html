  <h2>Hosting Your App's Static Content on GitHub</h2>

  <p>Simpl.js is designed for single-document javascript applications and modules. While this is all you need to create rich applications of any size using modern web APIs, you'll likely be looking for a cleaner way to incorporate static content into your apps. Whether you link to css, js, images, and other static assets, or proxy them through your Simpl.js application, they will need to live on some file server in the cloud.</p>

<h2>Tips For App Configuration</h2>
<div class="byline">June 10, 2015</div>
<p>If you're used to running or developing apps that accept arguments from a config file or the command line, you've likely spent more time wrestling with configuration syntax than you're comfortable admitting. Simpl.js takes some of this hassle out of configuration by accepting a single JSON-formatted <code>config</code> object as input to each app. As a developer, this means no <code>getopt</code> and no <code>eval</code> for parsing configuration data, but here are some additional pointers that will improve the user experience when configuring your app.</p>

  <h2>Isomorphic Javascript in Simpl.js</h2>
  <div class="byline">June 9, 2015</div>
  <p>Isomorphic javascript is code that runs on both the server and the client in a web application. Because it is reusable, isomorphic code can greatly reduce you application's code footprint, and the complexity and maintenance costs associated with it. Simpl.js was designed to realize the potential of isomorphic javascript without introducing unnecessary abstractions. It does so by leveraging features of the modern web platform, and through the use of markup generation techniques discussed here.</p>
