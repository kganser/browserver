<h2>Tips For App Configuration</h2>
<div class="byline">posted June 10, 2015, by Klaus</div>
<p>If you're used to running or developing apps that accept arguments from a config file or the command line, you've likely spent more time wrestling with configuration syntax than you're comfortable admitting. Simpl.js takes some of this hassle out of configuration by accepting a single JSON-formatted <code>config</code> object as input to each app. As a developer, this means no <code>getopt</code> and no <code>eval</code> for parsing configuration data, but here are some additional pointers that will improve the user experience when configuring your app:</p>
<ul class="list">
  <li><strong>Sane Defaults</strong> - Your app should work normally (or log a descriptive error message) if its <code>config</code> object is empty.</li>
  <li><strong>Backward Compatibility</strong> - Rather than reinterpreting a configuration field in a new version of your app, create a separate field and support both.</li>
  <li><strong>True JSON</strong> - Adhere to JSON semantics in your config file; don't use things like comma-delimited string values or objects with significant key ordering.</li>
</ul>
